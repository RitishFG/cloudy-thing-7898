        <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the user has made the payment and accessed the course content, no refund would be permitted.</li>
            <li>If a user is enrolled in a course that has been withdrawn by InternTheory, he/she will be entitled to
                100% refund within 15 working days (Monday to Friday, excluding national holidays) of the course being
                withdrawn and the refund would be initiated by Interntheory Courses.</li>
            <li>For advertisers who advertise their products, offerings, and services on different InternTheory channels
                (Website, Newsletter, Facebook page, other social media channels etc.), no refund/cancellation would be
                permitted after the advertising campaign has begun or the payment is received, whichever is earlier. If
                an advertising campaign is cancelled by InternTheory due to its internal policies, the advertiser would
                be entitled to a refund on a pro-rata basis (after deducting the amount for the deliverables already
                served)</li>
            <li>Not with-standing this policy, any specific terms and conditions mentioned on individual product &
                service page, and/or as agreed with a user before/during/after the transaction, will override the terms
                and conditions mentioned here in case of a conflict.</li>
            <li>We may make changes to our products & services, and associated terms & conditions (including terms and
                conditions on refund and cancellation), from time to time. You are advised to refer to our latest terms
                and conditions on this page and associated product/service specific terms and conditions page before
                making a purchase.</li>
