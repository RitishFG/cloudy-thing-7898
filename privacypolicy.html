        <p class="ques">California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
        <p class="ans">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
            post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
            United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
            being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more
            at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
        <p class="ques">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
        <p class="ans">Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it
            on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy
            link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

            Users are able to change their personal information:By logging in to their account</p>
        <p class="ques">How does our site handle do not track signals ?</p>
        <p class="ans">We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track

            Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking ?
            It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
        <p class="ques">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
        <p class="ans">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer
            protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must
            do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            We do not specifically market to children under 13</p>
        <p class="ques">Fair Information Practices</p>
        <p class="ans">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
            the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
            globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
            comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
        <p class="ques">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
            should a data breach occur:</p>
        <p class="ans">We will notify the users via email Within 7 business days
            We will notify users via phone call Within 7 business days
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
            legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
            requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
            recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
        <p class="ques">CAN SPAM Act</p>
        <p class="ans">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
            commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
            tough penalties for violations.</p>
        <p class="ques">We collect your email address in order to:
